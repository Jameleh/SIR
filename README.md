# ODESolvers
ODESolvers are software tools designed to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), fundamental in modeling dynamic systems across various domains such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics.

## How ODESolvers Work:
### Input ODE: 
Provide the ODE describing how the system changes over time. This equation typically includes a function representing the rate of change of a variable with respect to time.
### Initial Conditions:
Specify initial conditions, the starting values of variables at a particular point in time.
### Numerical Integration:
ODESolvers employ numerical integration techniques to approximate the solution of the ODE. Methods like Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and adaptive step-size methods discretize time to simulate the system's behavior.
### Iteration: 
The solver iteratively computes the values of variables at each time step based on the ODE and current system state. It updates variables until a specified endpoint or accuracy level is reached.
### Output: 
Once iteration is complete, the solver provides the solution, a set of values for variables over the specified time interval.
## Applications:
ODE solvers find application in simulations, control systems, optimization algorithms, and other areas where understanding dynamic behavior is crucial.

# SIR Model for Disease Spread Simulation
The SIR model is a mathematical model used to understand the spread of infectious diseases. It divides the population into three compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R), tracking how individuals move between these compartments over time.

## Dynamics:
Individuals transition from susceptible to infected when contracting the disease, then move to the recovered compartment, assumed to be immune to further infection. The model is governed by a set of ODEs describing rates of change of S, I, and R compartments over time.

## Using ODESolvers:
To simulate the SIR model, you input the differential equations representing it along with initial conditions into an ODESolver. The solver then numerically integrates these equations, iterating over time to calculate values of S, I, and R until reaching a specified endpoint or convergence criteria.

## Application:
Using ODESolvers enables simulation of disease spread over time, considering factors like transmission and recovery rates, aiding researchers and policymakers in understanding and evaluating interventions such as vaccination campaigns or social distancing measures.
